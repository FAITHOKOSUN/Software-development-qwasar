This code defines a function called difference that takes in two string parameters, str1 and str2. The function first checks if the two strings have the same length using the length method. If they do not have the same length, the function returns -1.

If the strings are the same length, the function then iterates through each character in str1 using the each_with_index method. For each character, the function checks if it is equal to the character at the same index in str2. If the characters are not equal, the function increments a counter called differences.

Finally, the function returns the value of differences.
