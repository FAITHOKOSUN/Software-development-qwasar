# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
I am to reproduce a game called mastermind in which the user is required to guess four digit of code. 
If correct, the user gets a congratz. If wrong, the user is prompted to try again.
The user has only 10 attempt.

## Description
I created a loop to count round 0 to 9 and a condition to print congratz if the user inputs
the correct key requested.

## Installation
There is no installation package for now.

## Usage
It is used as a game in which a user gets a prompt to guess four characters of code. If correct, they get a congratz.
