This code defines two functions, add_values and my_data_process, that work together to parse a data string and return a JSON string.

add_values is a helper function that adds values to a hash, where the key is a column name and the value is a sub-hash of values and their frequency of occurrence. It takes three arguments: result is the hash that will hold the final result, key is the column name, and value is the value being added to the sub-hash. The function uses the ||= operator to set the value of the key to an empty hash if it doesn't exist yet. Then, it sets the value of value to 0 if it doesn't exist yet, and increments it by 1. In this way, the function keeps track of the frequency of each value for each column.

my_data_process is the main function that does the data processing. It takes a string argument content_str, which is a comma-separated list of data rows. The function starts by creating a hash result with the required columns as keys and empty sub-hashes as values. It then shifts the first row from the input content_str as it contains the column names only and won't be processed further. Then, it loops through each row in content_str and splits it by commas to obtain the values for each column. The function then calls add_values to add each value to the corresponding sub-hash in the result hash.

Finally, the function returns the result hash in JSON format using the to_json method.

The _run function is a simple test function that initializes an input data string and calls the my_data_process function, printing the resulting JSON string to the console.
